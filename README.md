# Sport Ngin Tryouts App
Located in Nordeast Minneapolis, Sport Ngin builds applications and services to help the coaches and community volunteers spend less time on administrative duties and more time with their athletes, teaching them the fundamental values of sport and life: teamwork, respect, and discipline. The purpose of this project is to help coaches/volunteers better keep track of tryout scores. Logging in through their Sport Ngin account, coaches will be able to create customized tryout sessions and assign players a jersey number to score players on an anonymous basis. During tryouts, coaches can assign score each player where the total will be saved to their profile from the coach's account within Sport Ngin's platform. This application will work on a computer, tablet, or phone so that the coach can take it with them in the field. Coaches can also create a guest code for other coaches or volunteers to also help score during the tryout and have the scores saved in one place.
